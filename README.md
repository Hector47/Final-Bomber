Description
===========

Final-Bomber is a Dynablaster (Bomberman) remake developed in C# with XNA 4.0.
For now, it's only possible to play offline with a total of 5 players.

How to compile it ?
===================
I've just tested it on Windows 7, so I don't know if it will works on another platform. 
If you are on a unix-based OS or on Mac OS, look for Mono XNA.
If you are on Windows 7 or greater, you need to install **Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0** (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23714).
You have to get a version of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (Express version is enough => http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express).
If you use Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, you can't directly use XNA and you still need to install VS2010. 
To use XNA 4.0 in VS2012, an explanation is available in the wiki here: https://github.com/Noxalus/Final-Bomber/wiki/How-to-install-XNA-4.0-on-VS2012
